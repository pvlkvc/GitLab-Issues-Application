This is an assignment for the 1DV528 web programming course at Linnaeus University. It is an application making use of GitLab API to view and manage repository issues.

Application can no longer be accessed online.  
It is unique to gitlab.lnu.se.

Can also be run locally with npm start, but it requires setting up mongodb and providing your own environment variables (like application id).
For security reasons, environmental variables file is kept private and excluded from this repository.
